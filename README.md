# media_server

Simple media for hosting and watching your media files remotely with ease.

Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/arBalasquide/media_server.git` then...

To run the server:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run serve`

or for development alone:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

`npm start` starts the nodemon that automatically relaunches the main source file upon detecting changes.

May need root privileges to run (sudo)
